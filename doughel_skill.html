        <p>Heals allies for a certain period of time, and grants DMG Resist, Debuff Resist, and ATK buffs. Afterwards,
            Doughael's faith shines, Healing allies, dealing damage to enemies, pushing them back, and inflicting Sacred
            Preachings. Upon using Their skill, Doughael removes debuffs from targets with Disciple of the Abyss.
            Lastly, Doughael applies Fervor and Blessings of Devotion, Healing targets whenever they take damage over a
            certain period of time, and granting them Immunity to incapacitating effects.

            At the start of battle, Doughael grants Disciple of the Abyss to the ally with the highest ATK (excluding
            Themselves), increasing the ally's ATK and DMG Dampening. If this target is defeated, it will trigger
            Selfless Sacrifice, increasing Doughael's ATK and DEF. The buff will be applied to the next ally with the
            highest ATK. If Doughael is defeated, Disciple of the Abyss will further increase the target's ATK buff and
            speed up their Healing rate. Doughael's Cooldown decreases proportionally to Their HP increase rate as of
            the start of the battle, and They are immune to incapacitating effects.</p>
