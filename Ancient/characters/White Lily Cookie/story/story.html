		<h3>
			Forgotten Academy & Hall of Enlightenment<br>
		</h3>

        <h6>
			As students in the Blueberry Yogurt Academy, White Lily Cookie and Head Icon Pure Vanilla Cookie 
			researched the origin and creation of Cookies of their own volition, to the point that they broke 
			numerous academy rules and attempted to create living Cookies. Pure Vanilla Cookie eventually puts 
			the research to an end, while White Lily Cookie continues to study by herself, her experiments ultimately 
			converting the academy's inhabitants into spirits by accident. <br><br>White Lily Cookie then spent a long 
			time repenting for the accident, and did not see Pure Vanilla Cookie again until his coronation at the founding of the Vanilla Kingdom. 
			She appeared to gain the Soul Jam of the Light of Freedom during this time, and would later join the other 
			Ancient Heroes in bringing peace to the land of Earthbread.<br><br>
        </h6>
		
		<h3>
			Time in the Faerie Kingdom<br>
		</h3>

        <h6>
			White Lily Cookie would regularly set off on her own without a word to the other Ancient Heroes, 
			pursuing her original desire to understand the origins and purpose of Cookies in order to build a better 
			world for Cookiekind. She would eventually travel to Beast-Yeast, where a chance encounter with a wounded Head Icon 
			Silverbell Cookie allowed her to enter the mythical Faerie Kingdom. There, she aided the Faeries in repairing the seal 
			in the Silver Tree that kept the Beasts imprisoned, preventing "The Great Calamity" by strengthening the Silver Tree 
			with magical vines. This would earn her the eternal gratitude of the Faeries, who henceforth considered her one of their own. 
			<br><br>Although her time in the Faerie Kingdom was happy, she eventually grew impatient with their long-lasting celebrations. 
			She discovered information regarding the Witch's Banquet in the Faerie Kingdom Library; determined to ask the 
			Witches the answers to her questions, she set out in the night when all the residents of the Faerie Kingdom were asleep.
			However, Head Icon Elder Faerie Cookie appeared in her way and tried to convince her that the Banquet was too dangerous 
			for any Cookie, asking her to instead stay in the Faerie Kingdom and guarantee peace for the Cookie World in doing so. 
			Instead, White Lily Cookie promised him that she would never lose her love for the Cookie World regardless of what truths 
			she discovered at the Witches' Banquet, seeing that love as her own weapon to protect the world with. 
			Seeing that there was no changing her mind, Elder Faerie Cookie gave her a piece of Moonstone to travel back to the Faerie Kingdom in case of peril.
