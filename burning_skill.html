        <p>In exchange of his own lifeforce, Burning Spice Cookie releases his inner God of Destruction, dispelling
            debuffs and gaining the Berserker buff. While transformed, he will become immune to all debuffs except for
            Curse and will absorb the ATK of the three allies (targets Cookies first) with the highest ATK. Burning
            Spice Cookie will gain the Spice Rampage buff depending on the target of his basic attacks and will gain the
            Enrage buff after reaching a certain threshold. After, he will slam down the ground with his great axe,
            dealing damage with the final blow. The axe will create a pool of lava for a certain period of time and deal
            periodic damage. Enemies' ATK SPD and ATK are reduced in the lava, while the Sarcophagus of Gold and summons
            receive a great amount of damage.

            The Great Destroyer, Burning Spice Cookie, activates Firestorm periodically, inflicting Burn to all targets
            (excluding Safeguarded Cookies) and providing CRIT% and CRIT DMG buffs for his allies. Additionally, he
            applies The Destroyer's Gaze debuff on the enemy Cookie with the highest ATK.

            Upon entering the battle, Burning Spice Cookie applies the Revelry of Flames buff on Fire-type allies, which
            increases their ATK and DMG Resist by the number of Burn stacks. Additionally, Burning Spice Cookie's CRIT%
            increases according to the number of nearby targets with Burn. When hit by Water-type attacks for a certain
            number of times, a Burn debuff is removed.

            If Burning Spice Cookie is defeated, he becomes Immortal for a certain period of time and dispels debuffs.
            (DMG proportional to Max HP is capped at 300,000)</p>
