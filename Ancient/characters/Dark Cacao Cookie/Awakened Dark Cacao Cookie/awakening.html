        <p>
            Once, a lone sovereign's head bowed in despair behind the
			impenetrable walls of his castle. Shrouded in darkness, 
			his past was riddled with trials and tribulations—challenges
			that would have crumbled ordinary Cookies. Enemies tried to 
			infiltrate the walls, greedy hands sought the crown, and even 
			his own son betrayed him. Despite his bitter and destitute life,
			two things never lost their shine: his pride as a ruler and his 
			resolve, pitch dark as obsidian. Even when his dough crumbled from
			scaling the rocky mountains, even when he lost everything and everyone
			dear to him, his resolution remained unwavering and true. Now, he stands
			stronger than ever, commanding the two dragons that resting(sic)
			on his shoulders. This Cookie does not cower behind walls. He stands tall
			and regal, revered by his loyal subjects. His sword is raised high in triumph,
			sworn to protect the Cookie world, and his name is none other than… Dark Cacao Cookie.
