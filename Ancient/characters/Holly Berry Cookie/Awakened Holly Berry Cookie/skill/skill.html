        <h3>
         Sound the charge! Hollyberry Cookie charges forward with her Shield of Conviction. 
		 While her Shield of Conviction is active, she will absorb a portion of the damage allies take, 
		 excluding periodic and indirect damage. Afterwards, she will buff ally Cookies, reducing incoming 
		 CRIT DMG and making them resistant to DMG debuffs. <br><br>Hollyberry Cookie will gain the Seed of 
		 Life buff depending on the amount of damage received during Shield of Conviction. Once she gains 
		 enough Seed of Life stacks, it will bloom into Berry of Life. Steelbound Passion will activate 
		 depending on the amount of damage received during Shield of Conviction or after a certain period 
		 of time. Steelbound Guardian will activate once Hollyberry Cookie has gained enough stacks of Steelbound 
		 Passion or when her HP drops below a certain level. <br><br>Entering the Steelbound Guardian state will 
		 reset Hollyberry Cookie's Cooldown, restore HP, and enhance Shield of Conviction. Her Final Hit will be
		 buffed depending on the damage received during Shield of Conviction. The Cooldown for Hollyberry Cookie's
		 first skill activation is reduced, and while she is using her skill, she will briefly become resistant to
		 interrupting effects.<br><br>
