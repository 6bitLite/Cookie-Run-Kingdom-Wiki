        <h3>
         Like a true Paladin of unfaltering belief, Financier Cookie 
		 protects an ally Cookie from the start of the battle until the 
		 moment she hits the ground. Financier Cookie's top priority is 
		 Clotted Cream Cookie, but if he is not present, she'll protect the allied 
		 Cookie with the highest ATK. Upon using her skill, Financier Cookie's 
		 regular attack will deal area damage, she will also heal herself, 
		 the Cookie she is protecting, increase their ATK, DMG and CRIT Resist, 
		 and grant them the Light's Shield. She will then deal area damage against 
		 her enemies. The Light's Shield will act as a Shield and deliver the Light's 
		 Judgment to those who dare to damage it when it disappears. While Financier Cookie 
		 is using her skill, she will briefly become resistant to interrupting effects.<br><br>
