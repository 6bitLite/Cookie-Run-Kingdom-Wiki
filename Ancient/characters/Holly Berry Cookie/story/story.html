        <h6>
          Much like her Head Icon granddaughter, Hollyberry Cookie has a love for adventure and excitement, 
		  often venturing into the wilds on her own. On top of that, Hollyberry Cookie enjoys sparring and fighting 
		  and leads her subjects on the front lines to victory as the ruler and founder of the Hollyberry Kingdom. 
		  Being a fierce and fiery fighter, Hollyberry Cookie excels in the battlefield, and even emerges victorious 
		  in her spars with the Red Dragon, who acknowledges her as the only worthy opponent for them. 
		  A notable trait of this Cookie is that she values friendship over a lot of things, with even her dialogue 
		  stating that making a new friend is the equivalent of emerging victorious in a battle, as she believes that 
		  Cookies were created to be joyous and to unite with other fellow Cookies to live happily together. <br><br>
		  Similarly to her close friend Head Icon Pure Vanilla Cookie, Hollyberry Cookie deeply cares for her kingdom 
		  and the citizens within it, vowing to protect them. Her defeat in the Dark Flour War and her failure 
		  to protect her kingdom and subjects caused Hollyberry Cookie to withdraw from her kingdom and abdicate 
		  her position as ruler out of guilt, even abandoning her mighty shield, feeling that she no longer deserved the 
		  love and trust of her subjects. <br><br>Aside from being a resourceful and charismatic leader, Hollyberry Cookie has 
		  proven herself to be a loving mother and grandmother. She raised her son, Royal Berry Cookie, to be a 
		  humble and resourceful leader as the next heir to the Hollyberry Kingdom. But while she loved her son dearly, 
		  she also worried about his future, and how he'd accomplish his duties as ruler of the Hollyberry Kingdom. 
		  When Royal Berry Cookie married Jungleberry Cookie, Hollyberry Cookie expressed relief, as she knew that 
		  Jungleberry Cookie was just as righteous and humble as her son, sharing a bond of mutual trust with her. 
		  Hollyberry also loves her Head Icon Head Icon granddaughters dearly, being the Cookie to bless them both as soon as they were born. 
		  When Hollyberry Cookie and Princess Cookie were finally reunited, they grew to share a mutual respect for one another. <br><br>
		  Hollyberry Cookie wields the Light of Passion due to her desire and willingness to protect and fight for those she loves, 
		  but ever since the Dark Flour War, she left to find a more exciting lifestyle and left her son in charge of the kingdom. 
		  Something that she regrets, because she saw herself as a coward for abandoning her family, her friends and her responsibilities.
