        <h6>
			A particularly proud and ambitious hero, Golden Cheese Cookie equates wealth to godliness, 
			and sees no reason to be humble about it. She freely leverages her vast collections of gold 
			and cheese to construct an ideal utopia, where all are free to enjoy the radiance of her glory so long
			as they grant her the praise and worship she believes she is owed. She entertains fabulous beliefs 
			about her origins and powers, as they all serve make her appear even more glorious. 
			<br><br>Golden Cheese Cookie redefines greed not as a vice but as the will to claim what one desires. 
			Even in her youth, her willingness to brave inhospitable and desolate ruins for lost treasures was what 
			eventually led her to the Light of Abundance. Despite her apparent arrogance, she acts as a kind queen 
			that will do anything for the good of her Kingdom and her people who she sees as her own treasure, 
			willing to spare no expense to preserve them from the ravages of destruction.Although her time in the Faerie Kingdom was happy,
			she eventually grew impatient with their long-lasting celebrations. <br><br>Golden Cheese Cookie 
			wields the Light of Abundance due to her desire for a prosperous future and willingness to share that future with others. 
			Even long past the time she was the queen of the real Golden Cheese Kingdom, and having no subjects besides 
			the Cheesebirds, she remained true to her beliefs, her love for her subjects and treasures, as well as her status 
			as a fabled hero who valiantly protected those around her. Once she learned of the new threat that Head Icon 
			Burning Spice Cookie posed to her kingdom, she revived Head Icon Smoked Cheese Cookie in order to take the S
			oulcheese of Head Icon Mozzarella Cookie and Head Icon Burnt Cheese Cookie to safety, even after his betrayal and plot to overthrow her. 
			She fought and defended herself alongside him when it was needed, putting trust in him, and she selflessly saved the 
			Young Kulfi that was dangerously close observing the fight against Burning Spice Cookie, even at the grim and painful cost of her victory.
