        <p>It is said that he never ruled like the other Emissaries of the gods. Instead, he stood as the first among
            equals, bound by the oath of Solidarity. He and his loyal knights thus preached his Virtue across the Great
            Barren. Alas... Was the weight of his divine mission too great to bear alone? Even he, a warrior of
            unparalleled discipline, fell to whispers of corruption. After unleashing a calamity that claimed the lives
            of every Cookie who stood with him, he was sealed by magic, condemned to an eternity in darkness. His
            countless victims were cursed to wander endlessly through the land no living Cookie dared tread—the Land of
            Silence, as it was now called. Yet this tale was not destined to end there. Eons later, the Beasts awoke
            once more. Now, clad in black armor, gleaming in the pale, salt-crystal light of the moon, Silent Salt
            Cookie returns to his domain, carrying the same haunting stillness he left behind when he first swung his
            sword as the Devil of Silence.</p>
