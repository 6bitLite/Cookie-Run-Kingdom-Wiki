        <h6>
          Pure Vanilla Cookie shows himself to be a wise, benevolent, all-loving monarch 
		  who genuinely holds his subjects and kingdom dear and is beloved in return. 
		  He is seen as the epitome of many virtues. Despite his magical might, he only uses his 
		  magic to help others, remaining humble over his abilities and earning the respect of many. <br><br>
		  Even towards his supposed arch-nemesis Head Icon Dark Enchantress Cookie, he remains 
		  altruistic and puts effort into convincing her to change her mind. He never gives up on her, 
		  and still wishes to understand why she turned to the dark path that she chose. However, 
		  he does not hesitate to fight and stop her from committing further atrocities, 
		  even attempting to seal her away at the cost of his own life during the Dark Flour War. <br><br>
		  In Castle in the Sky, there is a glimpse of his mentality beneath the messianic exterior. 
		  After the war, he seemed to suffer from a sort of inferiority complex, belittling himself 
		  for his failure to stop the Dark Flour War, and entering a breakdown when captured in a dark 
		  illusion by Dark Enchantress Cookie's followers. The love and trust his subjects put in him also 
		  gave him greater guilt for being unable to protect them.<br><br>
		  He wields the Light of Truth due to his desire to learn the truth for the betterment and happiness of all Cookies. 
		  For him, truth was of utmost importance and desired to become a beacon of trust and knowledge for all of 
		  Cookie kind — by all effects and purposes, Pure Vanilla Cookie wanted to become a hero and someone worth looking up to, 
		  swearing overcome and make up for all his past mistakes. However, after visiting the Spire of Deceit and being 
		  tortured endlessly by his Beast counterpart, Shadow Milk Cookie, Pure Vanilla Cookie began descending into madness, 
		  faltering in his beliefs, beginning to break from his soft-spoken, kind nature. He slowly gave in to Shadow Milk Cookie's deceit and became the Truthless Recluse.<br><br> 
		  However, when it became clear that Shadow Milk Cookie was not going to save Pure Vanilla Cookie's friends' lives in exchange for the Soul Jam, 
		  Pure Vanilla Cookie's determination became strong enough for him to change the tides, 
		  with what seemed to be a little lie coming from the very wielder of the Light of Truth. 
		  Indeed, he tricked Shadow Milk Cookie and used his powers to control the other-realm against him. 
		  Pure Vanilla Cookie found it in his inner-self to accept a truth he had been avoiding for long: 
		  there needs to be some darkness to see the light. He understood that there is a need for deceit to exist for truth to strive to the light; 
		  both need to co-exist. Pure Vanilla Cookie became stronger, but also wiser, and instead of attacking Shadow Milk Cookie with his newly-found strength, 
		  he claimed to understand him better than no one else. Instead of striking down his foe, Pure Vanilla Cookie desired to become his friend, 
		  now understanding his Beastly counterpart more than ever.
