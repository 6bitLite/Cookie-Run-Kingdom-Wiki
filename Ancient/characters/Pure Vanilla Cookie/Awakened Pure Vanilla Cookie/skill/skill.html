         Pure Vanilla Cookie fully heals the team and reduces Injury. 
		 He will further heal the team for the amount of HP recovered 
		 from the reduced Injury. Provides HP Shield for all members of
		 the team. Whenever these HP Shields are dispelled, or the target
		 becomes unable to have an HP Shield, periodically heals the team
		 for a certain period of time. Next, he will summon Shards of Light
		 that will heal your team and deal damage to enemies, applying the 
		 Shards of Light debuff. <br><br>As long as Pure Vanilla Cookie
		 participates in the battle, he will select a Cookie and illuminate
		 them with the Light of Truth to restore their HP when it drops below a
		 certain point. Pure Vanilla Cookie will keep restoring their HP periodically
		 for some more time. This effect can trigger only once in a certain period of
		 time. <br><br>As someone who has witnessed both the Truth and Deceit,
		 Pure Vanilla Cookie will grant the team immunity from Silence and Cooldown 
		 debuffs at the beginning of battle if there are no other Healing Cookies in
		 the rear row. Once per battle, when his own HP drops below a certain point,
		 he will restore his HP, gain an HP Shield, and dispel all possible debuffs on
		 himself. Additionally, once per battle, Pure Vanilla Cookie will revive one
		 team member, himself included. However, this effect will not trigger if the entire
		 team is defeated mid-revival or if the target has already been revived.
		 <br><br>The higher Pure Vanilla Cookie's DMG Resist stat, the stronger Cooldown
		 buff he will receive at the beginning of the battle. His regular attacks will heal
		 up to 5 targets and increase their Amplify Buffs.<br><br>
