            Would you look at that? Gummy wires twisted here and there, sparks flying everywhere! 
			Maybe that's why Twizzly Gummy Cookie's temperament is like chaos itself! She insists 
			that if she doesn't wreak havoc even for one day, her hair will start crackling electricity! 
			*BZZZZT* With her ticking time bomb of a Electrojelly Gun, she will bulldoze a planet and pulverize 
			the planet right next to it! No wonder they call her the Cosmic Criminal—look at her cause absolute 
			mayhem everywhere she lands! To her, battles are just another game that gives her electrifying thrills. 
			Looks like she's done messing with her universe and ready to jump to another dimension! Just what could she be plotting next? 
			Her evil cackling and rampaging sparks can't be good news... Well, good luck to those who come in her way... 
			because it's gonna hurt!
