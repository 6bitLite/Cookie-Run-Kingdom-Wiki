        <p>Heralded long ago as the benevolent Fount of Knowledge, Shadow Milk Cookie is the antithesis of what his
            Witch-given purpose once was: he is a malicious trickster who relishes in chaos, confusion, and inequity.
            This sly entertainer spends his immortality in the Spire of Deceit, gaily weaving untruths and scheming to
            release Earthbread from its shackles of virtue with his lackeys Candy Apple Cookie and Head Icon Black
            Sapphire Cookie. Behind his mask of mirth, however, lies a lonely soul whose disillusionment wore him down
            to the cruel, manipulative individual he is today.

            Shadow Milk Cookie wields the power of Deceit, a corrupted side of the Virtue of Knowledge he once held. He
            was the original owner of Head Icon Pure Vanilla Cookie's Soul Jam, being stripped of it upon his descent
            into villainy.</p>
