        <h3>
         A flower bud that sprouted through adversity bursts open, 
		 dealing periodic damage to nearby enemies and additional 
		 damage depending on the number of buffs White Lily Cookie 
		 has on herself. Enemies affected by the skill will become 
		 entangled in Vines, unable to move or use skills for a 
		 certain time. The Bloom of Freedom deals damage to nearby
		 enemies, increases the Grass-type DMG they take, and applies
		 the Seeds debuff. The Seeds will sprout after some time, 
		 dealing damage to nearby enemies and entangling them in Vines.
		 Seeds' sprouting time will decrease whenever the target receives
		 Healing. <br><br>Whenever White Lily Cookie uses her skill
		 or when any team member gains a debuff, they will gain the
		 Dawn Lily Restoration buff. Once Dawn Lily Restoration reaches
		 a certain number of stacks, it will dispel all debuffs and heal
		 the targets, while granting Petals of Restoration to certain Cookies
		 from the team. <br><br>At the start of the battle, certain Cookies
		 from the team will gain Petals of Restoration. White Lily Cookie
		 cannot be Silenced or Shackled. Once per battle, if White Lily Cookie
		 is defeated, she will become unable to act but will be protected
		 by Remembrance of Yearning for a short while.<br><br>
