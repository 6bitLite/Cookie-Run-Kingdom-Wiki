        <h3>
         Upon using her skill, Golden Cheese Cookie throws her Spears of Radiance, 
		 dealing damage up to 8 times when there are five or more enemies. For each enemy defeated, 
		 she gains an extra Spear of Radiance. The number of Spears can increase to up to 12 in total. 
		 <br><br> When hit by the spear, enemies receive a debuff amplifying the Earth-type damage received.
		 While Golden Cheese Cookie is using her skill, she harnesses her Light of Abundance and hurls 
		 the Spear of the Absolute to the enemy Cookie with the highest ATK. The Spear of Absolute removes 
		 the target’s buffs, deals DMG, Explosion DMG, and additional DMG based on the current number of 
		 Spears of Radiance to all enemies in range. <br><br>Once per battle, if Golden Cheese Cookie is about to be defeated, 
		 she encloses herself in a Sarcophagus for a certain period of time. While enclosed in her Sarcophagus, 
		 she casts a Shield around herself. This Shield takes the DMG dealt to nearby allies covered by it and provides Knockback Immunity. 
		 <br><br>When using her skill, Golden Cheese Cookie is not affected by ATK Speed changes and is protected from the Glitch: 
		 Data Corruption effect by her Light of Abundance.<br><br>
