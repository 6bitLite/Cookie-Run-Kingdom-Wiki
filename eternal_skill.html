        <p>Eternal Sugar Cookie floats atop a cotton candy cloud, restoring her own HP, and gains an HP Shield and
            Immunity. She summons a Saccharine Breeze, Charming enemies and dealing Periodic Damage. Affected enemies
            suffer from the Delightful Temptation debuff, while Immune targets receive damage. Afterwards, the sugar
            coating cracks, dealing damage and putting enemies into an Enchanted state. Enchanted's duration increases
            based on the number of Delightful Temptation stacks. When Enchantment is dispelled, its duration is over, or
            the target is immune, the effect changes to Laxness. If the target is immune, they receive additional
            damage.

            Eternal Sugar Cookie's mythic beauty makes enemies who deal damage to her gain the Guilt debuff. At maximum
            stacks, Guilt will deal damage to the target in proportion to their ATK. The target will also receive
            Increased Damage and Reduced Healing.

            At the start of a battle, Eternal Sugar Cookie will appear floating atop a cotton candy cloud, surrounded by
            her Cotton Candy Angels. The Cotton Candy Angels will follow the rest of the team, buffing them and
            themselves, and dealing damage and debuffing the enemies. The fewer team members are left on the
            battlefield, the stronger this effect becomes. Eternal Sugar Cookie herself is resistant to Charm,
            Enchantment, and Laxness.</p>
