    <div class="description-box">
        <p>Elder Faerie Cookie strikes down with his sword containing Prism Energy to deal damage, taunt enemies, and
            purify debuffs on himself. Then, the energy in the sword causes an explosion, dealing more damage, applying
            Injury, and reducing the amount of Healing enemies receive.

            He shields his allies with an HP Shield proportional to his ally Cookies' Max HP, and the shield capacity
            increases with more buffs applied on Elder Faerie Cookie.

            Elder Faerie Cookie grants a Prism Shard and applies a DMG Resist buff to himself, White Lily Cookie, and a
            Cookie with the highest ATK (or two Cookies with the highest ATK if White Lily Cookie is not in the team).
            If Elder Faerie Cookie has the Beascuit HP upgrade, he can apply Prism Shards to more allies. Using a Prism
            Shard charge will heal the target's HP for a certain amount of time. Unlike other Cookies, White Lily Cookie
            will gain two Prism Shards.

            Elder Faerie's DMG Resist will increase when affected by a debuff. While Elder Faerie Cookie is using his
            skill, he will briefly become resistant to interrupting effects and immune to ATK SPD changes.</p>
