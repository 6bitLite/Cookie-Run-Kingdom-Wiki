		 Dark Cacao Cookie will borrow the strength of the Twin Dragons for a forceful 
		 downward strike, increasing Darkness-type damage and applying Consuming 
		 Darkness and Gloom. <br><br>At the beginning of battle, Dark Cacao Cookie
		 will increase the allies' DMG Resist with a Royal Decree. Inspired by his Kingly
		 Presence, he will gain increased DEF and Max HP and Charge Cookies will gain increased
		 ATK. Channel Darkness will become more efficient for Dark Choco Cookie, and his DMG
