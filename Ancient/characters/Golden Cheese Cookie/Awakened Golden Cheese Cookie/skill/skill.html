        <h3>
         Upon using her skill, Golden Cheese Cookie spreads her wings and throws her 
		 Spears of the Immortal, dealing damage up to 8 times when there are five or 
		 more enemies. For each enemy defeated, she gains an extra Spear of the Immortal. 
		 The number of Spears can increase to up to 12 in total. When hit by the Spear, 
		 enemies receive a debuff amplifying Earth-type damage and decreasing CRIT% and CRIT DMG. 
		 <br><br>While Golden Cheese Cookie is using her skill, she will inflict Immortal's Retribution
		 on the enemy with the lowest HP, applying Curse, Immortal's Punishment, Healing Prevention, 
		 and dealing damage. She then deals explosion damage to nearby enemies and additional damage
		 proportional to her Spear of the Immortal stacks. <br><br>Once per battle, Golden Cheese
		 Cookie will revive and enter the Immortal's Return state. In this state, her DMG Resist, 
		 ATK, and DEF will increase. Golden Cheese Cookie will also cover the team with the Dome
		 of Gold that will take damage instead of the allies and make them immune to Knockback. 
		 The great Immortal Golden Cheese Cookie increases all Ranged Cookies' DMG Resist and ATK.
		 (DMG proportional to Max HP is capped at 300,000.)<br><br>
