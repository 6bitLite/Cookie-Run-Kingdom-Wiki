        <p>Eons ago, there lived a Cookie, blessed with sweetness absolute. "Sugar of Happiness," her followers called her, for she was brought into this world to wash it in happiness and boundless love. Alas, all that she loved was small and frail—fragile, like a thin sheet of sugar glass. Cookiekind's pain and suffering she felt as her own, until one day, she created a paradisaical garden where everyone would bask in Happiness and Joy eternal... so long as they accepted Sloth. Thus, Eternal Sugar Cookie became her name. Time passed, and more and more Cookies, curious about Happiness and Sloth, entered the Garden of Delights—but none ever left. Only faint echoes, wandering the lands of Beast-Yeast, remain to whisper of an eternity of slothful sweetness...</p>
