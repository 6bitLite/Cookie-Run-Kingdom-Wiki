    <div class="description-box">
        <p>Creates the Realm of Apathy, shielding the allies with the Cocoon of Futility. Allies within the Realm of
            Apathy have their HP periodically restored. They will also gain the Touch of Meaninglessness buff. Once the
            duration of the Realm of Apathy is over, the allies will be Healed for a portion of the DMG they have dealt.

            The Cocoon of Futility cannot be Dispelled or removed by Zap or Overcurrent. The effect will remain even
            after the HP Shield reaches 0 capacity. If the target is at Max HP, incoming Healing will restore the HP
            Shield instead.

            If an enemy Cookie enters the Realm of Apathy, their Cooldown will be increased, otherwise their ATK SPD
            will be reduced. They will also be debuffed with the Pale Plague, increasing the remaining Cooldown when
            dispelled.

            Mystic Flour Cookie will increase her own DMG Resist based on the decreased amount of Cooldown. Her Lantern
            of Apathy will keep healing the allies regardless of Mystic Flour Cookie's current status and will be
            further enhanced when she is defeated.

            If there are no Safeguarded Cookies in the team, Mystic Flour Cookie cannot be incapacitated, and gains
            increased Max HP. The amount of Healing coming from the Lantern of Apathy and its trigger rate will also
            greatly increase. Ally Cookies will also be provided with Buff Protection.

            Mystic Flour Cookie is immune to Apathy along with all targets of the Cocoon of Futility and disrupts the
            Power of Apathy effect affecting enemies.</p>
