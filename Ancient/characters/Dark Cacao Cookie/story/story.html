        <h6>
			Dark Cacao Cookie is the strict and protective monarch of the Dark Cacao Kingdom. 
			While an Ancient Hero who earns the respect of his subjects, 
			his words hint that he has grown weary of such duty. Despite this, 
			his resolve to protect his kingdom and Earthbread allows him to continue bearing 
			the responsibilities he swore to uphold. Dark Cacao Cookie is also quite stoic, 
			his emotions are muted and reserved unless caught in certain situations, 
			such as being in battle or seeing Head Icon Pure Vanilla Cookie for the first 
			time since the Dark Flour War. Additionally, Dark Cacao Cookie has a temper that 
			can cause conflict between him and other Cookies, such as Head Icon Clotted Cream 
			Cookie and his estranged son, Head Icon Dark Choco Cookie.<br><br>Dark Cacao Cookie 
			puts great trust in his warriors and relies on them to execute his commands. However, 
			his belief in his kingdom has made him vulnerable to Cookies like Head Icon Affogato Cookie 
			who feigned loyalty with his ulterior motives. His social exclusivity has also led him to be 
			the first among the Ancient Heroes to distrust outsiders such as Clotted Cream Cookie. 
			<br><br>Dark Cacao Cookie wields the Light of Resolution due to his will and determination to protect
			not just his kingdom, but all of Earthbread. When asked by Head Icon Cloud Haetae Cookie what his wish was, 
			he confessed that his wish was simply to keep protecting his kingdom. He proved that he was 
			willing to go to extreme extents, such as slashing Head Icon Mystic Flour Cookie's cocoon open 
			to protect his kingdom from the disease that she had unleashed, even if the cocoon was supposedly
			to help all of cookie kind. Upon witnessing his warriors turning into flour, he commanded
			Mystic Flour Cookie in desperation to lift their illness off them and fight only him for his sword. 
			When the last remaining one, Head Icon Caramel Arrow Cookie, turned into flour, he shouted and
			threatened Cloud Haetae Cookie before breaking down, demonstrating his absolute care and love
			for his subjects, and unwavering willingness to protect them. <br><br>Deep down, as Mystic Flour
			Cookie points out, Dark Cacao Cookie has fears of not just losing his subjects but all of his efforts
			to protect his kingdom would be for naught, that he might be forgotten by his people. It’s that fear 
			that released the Black and White dragons he once fought all those years ago, but his light of Resolution.
			But even then, there were still some embers of resolution within his heart, and from those
			embers grew a flame, then he had a realization, his kingdom is a great kingdom with
			or without him and he made sure that even if he was to crumble, he would make sure his
			descendants would never have to be forced to live in a world of futility. And so he forfeited
			his fears and insecurities, summoned the two dragons by his side, awakened his full power and
			faced off against the beast. After that, he vowed to bring balance of rest and work in his life.
