        <p>
            What was the first lie ever told? No one knows for sure, but one Cookie claims to 
			have been born from it—Candy Apple Cookie! Her syrup is so sticky it can seal lips shut 
			and so glossy it leaves everyone staring in awe. Candy Apple Cookie believes she was 
			crafted by the Master of Deceit himself, Head Icon Shadow Milk Cookie. From the moment 
			she opened her eyes, her loyalty has been unwavering, dedicating herself to earning his love and trust. 
			Though indifferent to most things, Candy Apple Cookie has a flair for mischief and a passion for dressing up. 
			She delights in tricking other Cookies, giggling with sinister glee as they fall for her schemes, 
			only to dash off in search of Shadow Milk Cookie's approval. Beware—the first bite of the apple of lies is 
			always the sweetest!
