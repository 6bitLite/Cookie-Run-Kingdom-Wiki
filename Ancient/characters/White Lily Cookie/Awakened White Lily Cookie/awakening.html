            Why are Cookies baked so sweet, yet so fragile...? 
			White Lily Cookie's story began with a question. 
			On her way to the greater world full of wonder and 
			mystery—to the place that held the answer—she 
			encountered many more. Yet on this same path guided by
			curiosity, she made countless missteps and faced mistake
			that could never be mended nor forgiven. In the end, 
			cruel truth and darkness awaited White Lily Cookie... 
			But was it the end? A delicate blossom of hope in the 
			dark held new questions within. What does it mean to be 
			a Cookie? Can Cookies truly be happy in this world? 
			There are still truths to be brought to light, and White
			Lily Cookie rises again, her banner proud. Her dough may
			break and shatter, yet she will keep taking steps towards
			the place where Freedom dwells.
